I recently developed a To-Do List Application as one of my internship projects. My goal was to design an efficient and responsive task-management app that helps users organize their daily activities. This app allows users to easily add, manage, and track their tasks in a simple and user-friendly interface.

Highlights

Modern Design:
The app features a clean and minimal modern design, providing a smooth and clutter-free user experience with clear task organization.

Task Management:
Users can add new tasks, mark completed tasks, delete tasks, and manage their daily activities efficiently, helping them stay productive and organized.

JavaScript Functionality:
JavaScript is used to implement core functionalities such as adding tasks, deleting tasks, marking tasks as completed, and updating the task list dynamically without page reload.

Languages Used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
